# datascroller 
A python package offering data frame scrolling in the terminal.

Right now, the way to demo the core concept of datascroller is to run
datascroller/scroller.py in ipython and manually trigger the scroller
function on iris. Press "j" first once or twice, and then do the same
for "h." It's a start.
